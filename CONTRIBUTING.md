on the code this document should help you get started.

## Using GitHub Issues

GitHub issues is used to track bugs and enhancements.

If you have a general usage question please ask on [Q&A Discussion](https://github.com/ciscoo/gradle-java-template/discussions/categories/q-a).

If you are reporting a bug, please help to speed up problem diagnosis by providing as much information as possible.
Ideally, that would include a small sample project that reproduces the problem.

## Commit Messages

As a general rule, the style and formatting of commit messages should follow the guidelines in
[How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

In addition, any commit that is related to an existing issue must reference the related issue. For example, if a commit
in a pull request or pull request in general addresses issue \#123, it must contain the following at the bottom of the
commit message or pull request description.

```md
See #123
```
