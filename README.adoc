= Gradle Java Template

Foundation for building either Java projects or Java libraries. As the name implies, it utilizes Gradle as the build tool.

This project is primarily for personal projects, but others may find it useful.

== Conventions

The majority of the build logic is contained within the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/organizing_gradle_projects.html#sec:build_sources[`buildSrc`] directory. Many of conventions here are based on the conventions from JUnit, Spring Boot, Spring Framework, and personal opinons gathered from professional work.

== Getting Started

Clone or download a zip and update the following:

* Root project name in `settings.gradle.kts`
* Project description in `build.gradle.kts`
* POM configuration in `publishing-conventions.gradle.kts`
